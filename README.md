# Glass-Classification
Created Learning Models using Logistic, KNN, SVC, Random Forest and Boosting to predict the type of Glass and the measures or algorithms taken/used to improve the accuracy of prediction from (Glass.csv) dataset from Kaggle
We observed that Gradient Boosting algorithm performed better overall and was able to produce classification accuracy of 83%.
Hyper Tuning Parameters were used to tune the parameters of Neural Network to see the parameters for which maximum accuracy can be achieved.
